\chapter{Summary and conclusions}

Notes for the summary
\begin{itemize}
\item Methane hydrate sare brittle in my simulations, but they are quite ductile in experiments.
\end{itemize}

Notes for the conclusion
\begin{itemize}
\item since $G_c > 2\gamma_s$ the triggering of cracks might be important, and the details of the methane-water interaction might be crucial. OPLS-AA should be tested.
\end{itemize}
