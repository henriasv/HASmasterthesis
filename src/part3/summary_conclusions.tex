\chapter{Summary and conclusions}

\section{Summary of findings}
Notes for the summary
\begin{itemize}
\item Methane hydrate sare brittle in my simulations, but they are quite ductile in experiments.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
Notes for the conclusion
\begin{itemize}
\item Since $G_c = 2\gamma_s$ the methane hydrates are very brittle in my simulations. (the details of the methane-water interaction might be crucial). OPLS-AA should be tested.
\end{itemize}


\section{Outlook}
\begin{itemize}
\item Other potentials â€“ the problem with high poisson ratio.
\item Less ordered structures.
\item Other types of defects.
\item Experimental ductility of methane hydrates: Is there a timescale at which methane hydrates become ductile, or perhaps heterogeneities can make sure that methane hydrates can sustain a global strain comparable to the yield strain of the perfect crystal, but with pores of methane forming inside the material. 
\end{itemize}
