\chapter{Summary and conclusions}

\section{Summary of findings}
Notes for the summary
\begin{itemize}
\item Methane hydrates are brittle in my simulations, but they are quite ductile in experiments.
\item Reading data from disk is a bottleneck when analyzing data post-simulation. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
Notes for the conclusion
\begin{itemize}
\item Since $G_c = 2\gamma_s$ the methane hydrates are very brittle in my simulations. (the details of the methane-water interaction might be crucial). OPLS-AA should be tested.
\end{itemize}


\section{Outlook}
\begin{itemize}
\item Other potentials â€“ the problem with high poisson ratio.
\item Less ordered structures.
\item Defects of different geomentries.
\item Other loading modes.
\item Experimental ductility of methane hydrates: Is there a timescale at which methane hydrates become ductile, or perhaps heterogeneities can make sure that methane hydrates can sustain a global strain comparable to the yield strain of the perfect crystal, but with pores of methane forming inside the material. 
\item Develop a fracture analysis package for LAMMPS: Since so large amounts of data are needed for fracture analysis, it is probably a good idea to do big analyses live.
\item Implement support for TIP4P with P$^3$M and triclinic box to control shear stress.
\end{itemize}
