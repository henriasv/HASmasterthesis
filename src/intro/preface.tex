\chapter*{Preface}
\section{What is the master thesis?}
This thesis is a walkthrough of how to do molecular simulations, how to apply it to methane hydrates, and how to verify and interpret the results. In part, it is also a documentation of my work during the last year. If I have been strugling with a topic, and spent a lot of time figuring it out, this should be reflected in the thesis. Therefore, these parts will be more elaborate than other parts of the thesis.
