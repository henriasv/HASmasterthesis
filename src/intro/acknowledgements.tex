I met my supervisor, Professor Anders Malthe-Sørenssen, during my first semester of Bachelor's studies at the University of Oslo, and I was quickly taken in as part of a research group under his supervision. Later, Anders became my supervisor for the master's project, and I thank him for providing excellent feedback and advice through the work with this thesis. 

During the work with on this project, I have had the pleasure of sharing an office with Ph.D. candidates Kjetil Thøgersen, Anders Hafreager and Jørgen Trømborg. I thank them for useful discussions, both related to this thesis and everything else. 

I would also like to thank Gy\"orgy Hantal and Alexandru Botan for useful discussions on how to impose  fracture in molecular dynamics.

Finally, I want to thank friends and family, and of course Mari, for enriching my life outside of physics.
