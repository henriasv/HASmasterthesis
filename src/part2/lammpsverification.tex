\chapter{Verification of LAMMPS simulation setup}
In this chapter, i verify that my LAMMPS setup reproduces known results from the literature. This is necessary to trust the model to go further with modifications.

\section{Stabilizing methane hydrates}
The TIP4P/ICE potential should be able to stabilize a methane hydrate stucture. Therefore, I prepared an S1 hydrate using positions from \cite{Takeuchi2013}. These positions were derived using the TIP4P potential, so this configuration is not expected to be an equilibrium configuration for TIP4P/ICE. The hydrate equilibrated nicely, using a Nos√©-Hoover npt thermostat with a temperature rising from 0 to 30 Kelvin.
