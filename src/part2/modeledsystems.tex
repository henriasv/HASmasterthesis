\chapter{Modeled systems}
This chapter contains descriptions of the systems that I have modeled durung my Master project. 
\section{Bulk S1 hydrate}
\subsection{Elastic properties}

\section{Vega 2010}
\section{Cracking methane hydrate with non-isotropic expansion}
In an attempt to see fracture in methane hydrates, I induce a non-isotropic pressure condition on the an S1 hydrate. In order to control the nucleation point, i make a hole in the hydrate structure. A naive approach is to remove a single S1 unit cell from the system, and see what happens when it expands. A different approch might be to cut out a sphere or some other simple geometrical shape.
