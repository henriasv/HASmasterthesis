\chapter{Input file templates}
To be able to do many simulations of the same kind, but with either different paramenters of different random seed (to collect statistics), I have defined a way to make simulation templates. I have also made a (small) Python module {\tt template\_expander} that can be used to efficiently create systematic series of simulations from a template. My workflow has been: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a LAMMPS input script and check that it runs.
\item Substitute some commands and variables with custom identifiers.
\item Apply {\tt template\_expander} to create a series of simulations.
\end{enumerate}
