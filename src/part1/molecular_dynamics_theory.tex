\section{Rigid molecules - The SETTLE algorithm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There are several ways to keep a group of atoms constrained as a rigid molecule. The goal is to obtain the sme result as if the equation was integrated using holonomic constraints, but integrating the angular movement of rigid particles instead of ...***. Generally, one can use the SHAKE or the RATTLE algorithm. For the particular case of three rigid atoms, the SETTLE algorithm might be preferred. The SETTLE algorithm \cite{Miyamoto1992} is an analytical solution to the 3-particle constraint problem when integrating numerically the newtonian equations of motion. It implements the contraint by changing the positions and velocities of the constrained particles after each integration step.

The basic idea of the SETTLE algorithm is to use the positions on a triangle before, $\Delta A_0 B_0 C_0$, and after, $\Delta A_1 B_1 C_1$, an unconstrained integration step to determine rotation operations to perform on $\Delta A_0 B_0 C_0$ to achieve a triangle $\Delta A_3 B_3 C_3$ corresponding to a constrained integration step. When we know the rotation operations, we also know the positions $(A_3, B_3, C_3)$ which are what we want for an implementation of the algorithm.

Let us look at the water molecule as a triangle placed in the $X'Y'$ plane of an orthogonal coordinate system $X'Y'Z'$	with the center of mass in the origin, and the oxygen atom placed on the positive y-axis. We denote the triangle $\Delta abc$ beginning with $a$ being the position of oxygen, and $b$ and $c$ the hydrogen positions in the positive direction of rotation around the origin.  In this coordinate system, the triangle is uniquely defined by three numbers: $(r_a, r_b, r_c)$ being the position components $a_y$, $-b_y$ and $c_x$. Triangles denoted by lowercase letters are the canonical water molecule, or the equilibrium configuration. $\Delta ABC$ is a triangle with possibly any positions of the corners, on which we want to perform the contrain operation to get back to the canonical triangle. 

The main derivation of the settle algorithm involve four planes, $\pi_0, \pi_A, \pi_B, \pi_C$ and the assumption that displacement vector for each apex from the unconstrained to the constrained triangle should be parallell to the plane $\pi_0$ of the triangle before the integration step. 

The actual steps to perform in the SETTLE algorithm are (in primed coordinates):
\paragraph{Positions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate $\phi$ and $\psi$: \\
$\phi$ and $\psi$ can be calculated without any knowledge of forces.
\begin{equation}
\sin\phi = \frac{Z_{A_1}'}{r_a}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\sin\psi = \frac{Z_{B_1}' - Z_{C_1}'}{2r_c\cos\phi}
\end{equation}

\item Obtain intermidiate coordinates
\begin{align}
(X_{a_2}', Y_{a_2}',Z_{a_2}') &= (0, r_c\cos\phi, r_c\sin\phi)\\
(X_{b_2}', Y_{b_2}',Z_{b_2}') &= (-r_c\cos\psi, -r_b\cos\phi - r_c\sin\psi\sin\phi, -r_b\sin\phi + r_c\sin\psi\cos\phi)\\
(X_{c_2}', Y_{c_2}',Z_{c_2}') &= (r_c\cos\psi, -r_b\cos\phi + r_c\sin\psi\sin\phi, -r_b\sin\phi - r_c\sin\psi\cos\phi)
\end{align}

\item Calculate $\theta$ from assumption on forces, positions and velocities: \\
\begin{align}
	\alpha &= X'_{b_2} ( X'_{B_0}  -X'_{C_0})  +
	Y'_{b_2}( Y'_{B_0}  -Y'_{A_0}) 	+
		Y'_{c_2}( Y'_{C_0}  -Y'_{A_0}) \\
	\beta &= X'_{b_2} ( Y'_{C_0}  -Y'_{B_0})
		 		+Y'_{b_2}( X'_{B_0}  -X'_{A_0}) 	+
		 		Y'_{c_2}( X'_{C_0}  -X'_{A_0}) \\
	\gamma &= Y'_{B_1} ( X'_{B_0}  -X'_{A_0})
			-X'_{B_1}( Y'_{B_0}  -Y'_{A_0}) 	+
			Y'_{C_1}( X'_{C_0}  -X'_{A_0}) 	-
			X'_{C_1}( Y'_{C_0} - Y'_{A_0})
\end{align}
\begin{equation}
\sin \theta = \frac{\alpha\gamma - \beta \sqrt{\alpha^2 + \beta^2 - \gamma^2 )}}{\alpha^2 + \beta^2}
\end{equation}

\item Obtain final coordinates
\begin{align}
(X_{a_3}', Y_{a_3}',Z_{a_3}') &= 	(X_{a_2}' \cos\theta - Y_{a_2}'\sin\theta,
									 X_{a_2}' \sin\theta + Y_{a_2}'\cos\theta, Z_{a_2}')\\
(X_{b_3}', Y_{b_3}',Z_{b_3}') &= 	(X_{b_2}' \cos\theta - Y_{b_2}'\sin\theta, 
									 X_{b_2}' \sin\theta + Y_{b_2}'\cos\theta, Z_{b_2}')\\
(X_{c_3}', Y_{c_3}',Z_{c_3}') &=	(X_{c_2}' \cos\theta - Y_{c_2}'\sin\theta, 
									 X_{c_2}' \sin\theta + Y_{c_2}'\cos\theta, Z_{c_2}')
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
