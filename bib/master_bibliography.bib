abstract = {Despite the industrial implications and worldwide abundance of gas hydrates, the formation mechanism of these compounds remains poorly understood. We report direct molecular dynamics simulations of the spontaneous nucleation and growth of methane hydrate. The multiple-microsecond trajectories offer detailed insight into the process of hydrate nucleation. Cooperative organization is observed to lead to methane adsorption onto planar faces of water and the fluctuating formation and dissociation of early hydrate cages. The early cages are mostly face-sharing partial small cages, favoring structure II; however, larger cages subsequently appear as a result of steric constraints and thermodynamic preference for the structure I phase. The resulting structure after nucleation and growth is a combination of the two dominant types of hydrate crystals (structure I and structure II), which are linked by uncommon 5(12)6(3) cages that facilitate structure coexistence without an energetically unfavorable interface.},

abstract = {We report the diffusion coefficient and viscosity of popular rigid water models: two non-polarizable ones (SPC/E with three sites, and TIP4P/2005 with four sites) and a polarizable one (Dang-Chang, four sites). We exploit the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the system size (Yeh and Hummer 2004 J. Phys. Chem. B 108 15873) to obtain the size-independent value. This also provides an estimate of the viscosity of all water models, which we compare to the Green-Kubo result. In all cases, a good agreement is found. The TIP4P/2005 model is in better agreement with the experimental data for both diffusion and viscosity. The SPC/E and Dang-Chang models overestimate the diffusion coefficient and underestimate the viscosity.},

@article{Yeh2004,
abstract = {We study the system-size dependence of translational diffusion coefficients and viscosities in molecular dynamics simulations under periodic boundary conditions. Simulations of water under ambient conditions and a Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid show that the diffusion coefficients increase strongly as the system size increases. We test a simple analytic correction for the system-size effects that is based on hydrodynamic arguments. This correction scales as N-1/3, where N is the number of particles. For a cubic simulation box of length L, the diffusion coefficient corrected for system-size effects is D-0 = D-PBC + 2.837297k(B)T/(6.7pietaL), where D-PBC is the diffusion coefficient calculated in the simulation, k(B) the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, and eta the shear viscosity of the solvent. For water, LJ fluids, and hard-sphere fluids, this correction quantitatively accounts for the system-size dependence of the calculated self-diffusion coefficients. In contrast to diffusion coefficients, the shear viscosities of water and the LJ fluid show no significant system-size dependences.},

Tests imposing axial elongation with fixed lateral dimensions established C» and C». Axial deformation with zero lateral pressure (a tension test) was used to determine S», S», E\&oo and v\&oo. This provided an independent set of results for comparison with the dilatational stiffnesses C» and C». The bulk modulus K was obtained by independent triaxial tension testing. The stiffnesses, compliances, and moduli were determined by re- gression analysis and digital filtering applied to combinations of the stress-tensor and strain-tensor data stored at each iteration during the constant-rate deformation experiments. While the cubic fcc Lennard-Jones solid expectedly obeys the Cauchy relations for central-force potentials, it is not isotro- pic, allowing v to take on values other than —' as originally proposed by Poisson. The present calcula- tions show v\&OO=0. 347 for the fcc Lennard-Jones solid with a Young's modulus of E\&oo =61.1c/o, an initial (as indicated by superscript 0) shear modulus of G\&oo =57.2c/o. , and an initial bulk modulus of K =71.2c, /o. at zero temperature. The moduli all decreased with increasing temperature. Reuss, Voigt, and Hashin and Shtrikman [J. Mech. Phys. Solids 10, 335 (1962)] bounds on the isotropic elastic properties of polycrystalline aggregates of Lennard-Jones material were also determined. Computed values of the moduli are in reasonable agreement with experimental results for solid argon and crystalline polyethylene.},

@article{Abascal2005,
abstract = {The ability of several water models to predict the properties of ices is discussed. The emphasis is put on the results for the densities and the coexistence curves between the different ice forms. It is concluded that none of the most commonly used rigid models is satisfactory. A new model specifically designed to cope with solid-phase properties is proposed. The parameters have been obtained by fitting the equation of state and selected points of the melting lines and of the coexistence lines involving different ice forms. The phase diagram is then calculated for the new potential. The predicted melting temperature of hexagonal ice (Ih) at 1 bar is 272.2 K. This excellent value does not imply a deterioration of the rest of the properties. In fact, the predictions for both the densities and the coexistence curves are better than for TIP4P, which previously yielded the best estimations of the ice properties.},

@article{Conde2010,
abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to estimate the three-phase (solid hydrate-liquid water-gaseous methane) coexistence line for the water-methane binary mixture. The temperature at which the three phases are in equilibrium was determined for three different pressures, namely, 40, 100, and 400 bar by using direct coexistence simulations. In the simulations water was described by using either TIP4P, TIP4P/2005, or TIP4P/Ice models and methane was described as simple Lennard-Jones interaction site. Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules were used to obtain the parameters of the cross interactions. For the TIP4P/2005 model positive deviations from the energetic Lorentz-Berthelot rule were also considered to indirectly account for the polarization of methane when introduced in liquid water. To locate the three-phase coexistence point, two different global compositions were used, which yielded (to within statistical uncertainty) the same predictions for the three-phase coexistence temperatures, although with a somewhat different time evolution. The three-phase coexistence temperatures obtained at different pressures when using the TIP4P/Ice model of water were in agreement with the experimental results. The main reason for this is that the TIP4P/Ice model reproduces the melting point of ice I(h).},

@article{Takeuchi2013,
abstract = {Position and orientation of water protons need to be specified when the molecular simulation studies are performed for clathrate hydrates. Positions of oxygen atoms in water are experimentally determined by X-ray diffraction analysis of clathrate hydrate structures, but positions of water hydrogen atoms in the lattice are disordered. This study reports a determination of the water proton coordinates in unit cell of structure I (sI), II (sII), and H (sH) clathrate hydrates that satisfy the ice rules, have the lowest potential energy configuration for the protons, and give a net zero dipole moment. Possible proton coordinates in the unit cell were chosen by analyzing the symmetry of protons on the hexagonal or pentagonal faces in the hydrate cages and generating all possible proton distributions which satisfy the ice rules. We found that in the sI and sII unit cells, proton distributions with small net dipole moments have fairly narrow potential energy spreads of about 1 kJ∕mol. The total Coulomb potential on a test unit charge placed in the cage center for the minimum energy∕minimum dipole unit cell configurations was calculated. In the sI small cages, the Coulomb potential energy spread in each class of cage is less than 0.1 kJ∕mol, while the potential energy spread increases to values up to 6 kJ∕mol in sH and 15 kJ∕mol in the sII cages. The guest environments inside the cages can therefore be substantially different in the sII case. Cartesian coordinates for oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the sI, sII, and sH unit cells are reported for reference.},
