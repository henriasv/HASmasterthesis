abstract = {Despite the industrial implications and worldwide abundance of gas hydrates, the formation mechanism of these compounds remains poorly understood. We report direct molecular dynamics simulations of the spontaneous nucleation and growth of methane hydrate. The multiple-microsecond trajectories offer detailed insight into the process of hydrate nucleation. Cooperative organization is observed to lead to methane adsorption onto planar faces of water and the fluctuating formation and dissociation of early hydrate cages. The early cages are mostly face-sharing partial small cages, favoring structure II; however, larger cages subsequently appear as a result of steric constraints and thermodynamic preference for the structure I phase. The resulting structure after nucleation and growth is a combination of the two dominant types of hydrate crystals (structure I and structure II), which are linked by uncommon 5(12)6(3) cages that facilitate structure coexistence without an energetically unfavorable interface.},

abstract = {Three distinct forms are derived for the force virial contribution to the pressure and stress tensor of a collection of atoms interacting under periodic boundary conditions. All three forms are written in terms of forces acting on atoms, and so are valid for arbitrary many-body interatomic potentials. All three forms are mathematically equivalent. In the special case of atoms interacting with pair potentials, they reduce to previously published forms. (i) The atom-cell form is similar to the standard expression for the virial for a finite nonperiodic system, but with an explicit correction for interactions with periodic images. (ii) The atom form is particularly suited to implementation in modern molecular dynamics simulation codes using spatial decomposition parallel algorithms. (iii) The group form of the virial allows the contributions to the virial to be assigned to individual atoms.},

abstract = {The thermal conductivities of common water models are compared using equilibrium (EMD) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. A complete accounting for electrostatic contributions to the heat flux was found to resolve the previously reported differing results of NEMD and EMD Green-Kubo measurements for the extended simple point-charge (SPC/E) model. Accordingly, we demonstrate the influence of long-range electrostatics on the thermal conductivity with a simple coulomb cutoff, Ewald summation, and by an extended particle-particle particle-mesh method. For each water model, the thermal conductivity is computed and decomposed in terms of frequency-dependent thermodynamic and topological contributions. The rigid, three-site SPC, SPC/E, and transferable intermolecular potential (TIP3P-Ew) water models are shown to have similar thermal conductivity values at standard conditions, whereas models that include bond stretching and angle bending have higher thermal conductivities.},

We exploit the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the system size (Yeh and Hummer 2004 J. Phys. Chem. B 108 15873) to obtain the size-independent value. This also provides an estimate of the viscosity of all water models, which we compare to the Green-Kubo result. In all cases, a good agreement is found. The TIP4P/2005 model is in better agreement with the experimental data for both diffusion and viscosity.

abstract = {We study the system-size dependence of translational diffusion coefficients and viscosities in molecular dynamics simulations under periodic boundary conditions. Simulations of water under ambient conditions and a Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid show that the diffusion coefficients increase strongly as the system size increases. We test a simple analytic correction for the system-size effects that is based on hydrodynamic arguments. This correction scales as N-1/3, where N is the number of particles. For a cubic simulation box of length L, the diffusion coefficient corrected for system-size effects is D-0 = D-PBC + 2.837297k(B)T/(6.7pietaL), where D-PBC is the diffusion coefficient calculated in the simulation, k(B) the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, and eta the shear viscosity of the solvent. For water, LJ fluids, and hard-sphere fluids, this correction quantitatively accounts for the system-size dependence of the calculated self-diffusion coefficients. In contrast to diffusion coefficients, the shear viscosities of water and the LJ fluid show no significant system-size dependences.},

While the cubic fcc Lennard-Jones solid expectedly obeys the Cauchy relations for central-force potentials, it is not isotro- pic, allowing v to take on values other than —' as originally proposed by Poisson.

The emphasis is put on the results for the densities and the coexistence curves between the different ice forms. It is concluded that none of the most commonly used rigid models is satisfactory. A new model specifically designed to cope with solid-phase properties is proposed. The parameters have been obtained by fitting the equation of state and selected points of the melting lines and of the coexistence lines involving different ice forms. The phase diagram is then calculated for the new potential. The predicted melting temperature of hexagonal ice (Ih) at 1 bar is 272.2 K. This excellent value does not imply a deterioration of the rest of the properties. In fact, the predictions for both the densities and the coexistence curves are better than for TIP4P, which previously yielded the best estimations of the ice properties.},

For comparison, at temperatures just below the ice point, methane hydrate at a given strain rate is over 20 times stronger than ice, and the contrast increases at lower temperatures. The possible occurrence of syntectonic dissociation of methane hydrate to methane plus free water in these experiments suggests that the high strength measured here may be only a lower bound. On Earth, high strength in hydrate-bearing formations implies higher energy release upon decomposition and subsequent failure. In the outer solar system, if Titan has a 100-km-thick near-surface layer of high-strength, low-thermal conductivity methane hydrate as has been suggested, its interior is likely to be considerably warmer than previously expected},

@article{Conde2010,
abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to estimate the three-phase (solid hydrate-liquid water-gaseous methane) coexistence line for the water-methane binary mixture. The temperature at which the three phases are in equilibrium was determined for three different pressures, namely, 40, 100, and 400 bar by using direct coexistence simulations. In the simulations water was described by using either TIP4P, TIP4P/2005, or TIP4P/Ice models and methane was described as simple Lennard-Jones interaction site. Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules were used to obtain the parameters of the cross interactions. For the TIP4P/2005 model positive deviations from the energetic Lorentz-Berthelot rule were also considered to indirectly account for the polarization of methane when introduced in liquid water. To locate the three-phase coexistence point, two different global compositions were used, which yielded (to within statistical uncertainty) the same predictions for the three-phase coexistence temperatures, although with a somewhat different time evolution. The three-phase coexistence temperatures obtained at different pressures when using the TIP4P/Ice model of water were in agreement with the experimental results. The main reason for this is that the TIP4P/Ice model reproduces the melting point of ice I(h).},

abstract = {Position and orientation of water protons need to be specified when the molecular simulation studies are performed for clathrate hydrates. Positions of oxygen atoms in water are experimentally determined by X-ray diffraction analysis of clathrate hydrate structures, but positions of water hydrogen atoms in the lattice are disordered. This study reports a determination of the water proton coordinates in unit cell of structure I (sI), II (sII), and H (sH) clathrate hydrates that satisfy the ice rules, have the lowest potential energy configuration for the protons, and give a net zero dipole moment. Possible proton coordinates in the unit cell were chosen by analyzing the symmetry of protons on the hexagonal or pentagonal faces in the hydrate cages and generating all possible proton distributions which satisfy the ice rules. We found that in the sI and sII unit cells, proton distributions with small net dipole moments have fairly narrow potential energy spreads of about 1 kJ∕mol. The total Coulomb potential on a test unit charge placed in the cage center for the minimum energy∕minimum dipole unit cell configurations was calculated. In the sI small cages, the Coulomb potential energy spread in each class of cage is less than 0.1 kJ∕mol, while the potential energy spread increases to values up to 6 kJ∕mol in sH and 15 kJ∕mol in the sII cages. The guest environments inside the cages can therefore be substantially different in the sII case. Cartesian coordinates for oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the sI, sII, and sH unit cells are reported for reference.},
