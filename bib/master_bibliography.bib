abstract = {Despite the industrial implications and worldwide abundance of gas hydrates, the formation mechanism of these compounds remains poorly understood. We report direct molecular dynamics simulations of the spontaneous nucleation and growth of methane hydrate. The multiple-microsecond trajectories offer detailed insight into the process of hydrate nucleation. Cooperative organization is observed to lead to methane adsorption onto planar faces of water and the fluctuating formation and dissociation of early hydrate cages. The early cages are mostly face-sharing partial small cages, favoring structure II; however, larger cages subsequently appear as a result of steric constraints and thermodynamic preference for the structure I phase. The resulting structure after nucleation and growth is a combination of the two dominant types of hydrate crystals (structure I and structure II), which are linked by uncommon 5(12)6(3) cages that facilitate structure coexistence without an energetically unfavorable interface.},

The way in which it interacts with some relatively simple interfaces is also discussed.

abstract = {Nos\'{e} has modified Newtonian dynamics so as to reproduce both the canonical and the isothermal-isobaric probability densities in the phase space of an N-body system. He did this by scaling time (with s) and distance (with V1/D in D dimensions) through Lagrangian equations of motion. The dynamical equations describe the evolution of these two scaling variables and their two conjugate momenta ps and pv. Here we develop a slightly different set of equations, free of time scaling. We find the dynamical steady-state probability density in an extended phase space with variables x, px, V, $\epsilon$̇, and $\zeta$, where the x are reduced distances and the two variables $\epsilon$̇ and $\zeta$ act as thermodynamic friction coefficients. We find that these friction coefficients have Gaussian distributions. From the distributions the extent of small-system non-Newtonian behavior can be estimated. We illustrate the dynamical equations by considering their application to the simplest possible case, a one-dimensional classical harmonic oscillator.},

In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress‐strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress‐strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is suggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally under extreme conditions of shock.},

By carrying out steepest-descent mappings of system configurations onto potential-energy minima, two main conclusions emerge: (1) a temperature-independent inherent structure underlies the liquid phase, just as for ‘‘simple’’ liquids with only pair interactions; (2) the Lindemann melting criterion for the crystal apparently can be supplemented by a freezing criterion for the liquid, where both involve critical values of appropriately defined mean displacements from potential minima.},

abstract = {The ability of simple potential functions to reproduce accurately the density of liquid water from ?37 to 100 °C at 1 to 10 000 atm has been further explored. The result is the five-site TIP5P model, which yields significantly improved results; the average error in the density over the 100° temperature range from ?37.5 to 62.5 °C at 1 atm is only 0.006 g cm?3. Classical Monte Carlo statistical mechanics calculations have been performed to optimize the parameters, especially the position of the negative charges along the lone-pair directions. Initial calculations with 216 molecules in the NPT ensemble at 1 atm focused on finding a model that reproduced the shape of the liquid density curve as a function of temperature. Calculations performed for 512 molecules with the final TIP5P model demonstrate that the density maximum near 4 °C at 1 atm is reproduced, while high-quality structural and thermodynamic results are maintained. Attainment of high precision for the low-temperature runs required sampling for more than 1 billion Monte Carlo configurations. In addition, the dielectric constant was computed from the response to an applied electric field; the result is 81.5?1.5 at 25 °C and the experimental curve is mirrored from 0–100 °C at 1 atm. The TIP5P model is also found to perform well as a function of pressure; the density of liquid water at 25 °C is reproduced with an average error of ?2\% over the range from 1 to 10 000 atm, and the shift of the temperature of maximum density to lower temperature with increasing pressure is also obtained. ©},

abstract = {A complete set of intermolecular potential functions has been developed for use in computer simulations of proteins in their native environment. Parameters are reported for 25 peptide residues as well as the common neutral and charged terminal groups. The potential functions have the simple Coulomb plus Lennard-Jones form and are compatible with the widely used models for water, TIP4P, TIP3P, and SPC. The parameters were obtained and tested primarily in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations of 36 pure organic liquids and numerous aqueous solutions of organic ions representative of subunits in the side chains and backbones of proteins. Bond stretch, angle bend, and torsional terms have been adopted from the AMBER united-atom force field. As reported here, further testing has involved studies of conformational energy surfaces and optimizations of the crystal structures for four cyclic hexapeptides and a cyclic pentapeptide. The average root-mean-square deviation from the X-ray structures of the crystals is only 0.17 A for the atomic positions and 3\% for the unit cell volumes. A more critical test was then provided by performing energy minimizations for the complete crystal of the protein crambin, including 182 water molecules that were initially placed via a Monte Carlo simulation. The resultant root-mean-square deviation for the non-hydrogen atoms is still ca. 0.2 A and the variation in the errors for charged, polar, and nonpolar residues is small. Improvement is apparent over the AMBER united-atom force field which has previously been demonstrated to be superior to many alternatives.},

  Abstract = {Dynamic fracture is investigated for two-dimensional notched solids under tension using million atom systems. Brittle material and ductile material are modeled through the choice of interatomic potential functions which are Lennard-Jones and embedded-atom potentials, respectively. Numerical calculations are carried out on the \{IBN\} \{SP\} parallel computer and molecular dynamics is implemented using a spatial-decomposition algorithm. Many recent laboratory findings occur in our simulation experiments. A detailed comparison between laboratory and computer experiments is presented, and microscopic processes are identified. For rapid brittle fracture, the dynamic instability of the crack growth is observed as the crack velocity approaches one-third of the Rayleigh wave speed. At higher crack velocity, the crack either follows a wavy path or branches and the anisotropy due to the large deformation at the crack tip plays the governing role in determining the crack path. Limited comparison of rapid brittle fracture process with the rapid ductile fracture process is made. },

  Abstract = {We present a theoretical study of the thermodynamic chemical equilibrium of gas hydrate in soil by taking into account the influence of temperature, pressure, pore water chemistry, and the mean pore size distribution. The model uses a new formulation based on the enthalpy form of the law of conservation of energy. The developed model shows that due to a temperature and pressure increase, hydrates may dissociate at the top of the hydrate occurrence zone to ensure a chemical equilibrium with the surrounding bulk water. This original result confirms what has been already shown through experiments. The second part of the paper presents an application of the model through a back-analysis of the giant Storegga Slide on the Norwegian margin. Two of the most important changes during and since the last deglaciation (hydrostatic pressure due to the change of the sea level and the increase of the sea water temperature) were considered in the calculation. Simulation results show that melting of gas hydrate due to the change of the gas solubility can be at the origin of a retrogressive failure initiated at the lower part of the Storegga slope. Once again, the developed model leads to predictions, which are supported by laboratory experiment results, but contradictory to previous interpretations and beliefs considering that hydrate dissociation occurs only at the bottom of the gas hydrate stability zone. },

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18\% overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen–oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self‐diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

abstract = {Methane is the prototypic hydrophobic molecule; it has an extremely low solubility in liquid water that leads to phase segregation. On the other hand, at moderate pressures and room temperature, water and methane form hydrate clathrate crystals with a methane to water ratio up to a 1000 times higher than the saturated aqueous phase. This apparent dichotomy points to a subtle balance between the strong water-water hydrogen bonding, responsible for the hydrophobic effect, and water-methane attraction. Capturing these nuances with molecular models requires an appropriate balance of intermolecular interactions. Here we present such a coarse-grained molecular model of water and methane that represents each molecule by a single particle interacting through very short-range interaction potentials. The model is based on the monatomic model of water mW [Molinero, V.; Moore, E. B. J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113, 4008] and is between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than atomistic models with Ewald sums. The coarse-grained model of this study reproduces the solubility and hydration number of methane in liquid water, the surface tension of the water-methane interface and the equilibrium melting temperature of methane hydrate clathrates with structures sI and sII. To the best of our knowledge this is the first force-field, atomistic or coarse-grained, that reproduces these range of properties of liquid and solid phases of water and methane, making it an efficient and accurate model for the study of the mechanisms of nucleation and growth of clathrates. We expect that the results of this work will also be useful for the modeling of the hydrophobic assembly in aqueous solutions and the development of coarse-grained models of biomolecules with explicit solvation.},

  Abstract = {Natural gas-hydrates are an unconventional source of energy. Potential reserves of hydrated gas are over 1.5&#xa0;×&#xa0;1016 m3 and are distributed all over the earth both on the land and offshore. Presently, in many countries national programs exist for the research and production of natural gas from gas-hydrate deposits. As a result over 220 gas hydrate deposits have been discovered, more than a hundred wells drilled, and kilometers of hydrated cores studied. Properties of the hydrated cores have been investigated, effective tools for the recovery of gas from the hydrate deposits prepared and new technology for the exploration of gas-hydrate fields developed. The commercial production of natural gas from gas-hydrates exist for many years now with good results. Still, many complex problems have to be studied. More high-level studies on the properties of the gas-hydrates are needed and new technology for the production of natural gas from gas-hydrates has to be developed. Note, it is not the amount of potential reserves of hydrated gas that is important, but the volume of gas that can be commercially produced (17&#xa0;--&#xa0;20% from potential). },

@article{Milkov2004183,
  Abstract = {It is generally assumed that oceanic gas hydrates contain a huge volume of natural gases, mainly methane. The most widely cited estimate of global hydrate-bound gas is 21×1015 m3 of methane at \{STP\} (or ∼10,000 Gt of methane carbon), which is proposed as a ``consensus value'' from several independent estimations. This large gas hydrate reservoir is further suggested as an important component of the global carbon cycle and as a future energy source. Here, I present a revised and updated set of well-justified global estimates and discuss how and why they changed over time. It appears that the global estimates of hydrate-bound gas decreased by at least one order of magnitude from 1970s--early 1980s (estimates on the order of 1017--1018 m3) to late 1980s--early 1990s (1016 m3) to late 1990s--present (1014--1015 m3). The decrease of estimates is a result of growing knowledge of the distribution and concentration of gas hydrates in marine sediments and ongoing efforts to better constrain the volume of hydrate-bearing sediments and their gas yield. These parameters appear to be relatively well constrained at present through DSDP/ODP drilling and direct measurements of gas concentrations in sediments. The global estimate of hydrate-bound gas that best reflects the current knowledge of submarine gas hydrate is in the range (1--5)×1015 m3 (∼500--2500 Gt of methane carbon). A significantly smaller global gas hydrate inventory implies that the role of gas hydrates in the global carbon cycle may not be as significant as speculated previously. Gas hydrate may be considered a future energy source not because the global volume of hydrate-bound gas is large, but because some individual gas hydrate accumulations may contain significant and concentrated resources that may be profitably recovered in the future. },

Our present knowledge on these controlling factors is discussed and new estimates of global sediment and methane fluxes are provided applying a transport-reaction model at global scale.

abstract = {Solid compds., resembling snow or ice in appearance, are formed with CH4, C2H6, C3H3 and iso-C4H10 in the presence of H2O at elevated pressures and temps. The formation of gas hydrates in natural-gas pipe lines depends primarily upon the pressure, temp. and compn. of the gas-water vapor mixt. The formation is accelerated by high velocities of the gas stream, pressure pulsations, or innoculation with a small crystal of the hydrate. At equil. conditions the hydrates, because of their lower vapor pressure, cause more H2O to be removed from the vapor phase than in the case of liquid H2O at the same temp. and pressure. The m. p. of these mixed hydrates in a natural-gas mixt. depends upon the pressure and varies from about 34¬∞F. at 110 lb. per sq. in. abs. to about 60¬∞F. at 800 lbs. A math. relationship between pressure and m. p. of the gas hydrates is given as Y = 8.9X0.285, where Y = temp. in ¬∞F. and X = abs. pressure in lbs. per sq. in.

@article{Cao2004,
abstract = {The diffusivities of methane in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are investigated at various temperatures and pressures using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations complemented with grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. The carbon atoms at the nanotubes are structured according to the (m, m) armchair arrangement and the interactions between each methane molecule and all atoms of the confining surface are explicitly considered. It is found that the parallel self-diffusion coefficient of methane in an infinitely long, defect-free SWNT decreases dramatically as the temperature falls, especially at subcritical temperatures and high loading of gas molecules when the adsorbed gas forms a solidlike structure. With the increase in pressure, the diffusion coefficient first declines rapidly and then exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior due to the layering transitions of the adsorbed gas molecules as seen in the equilibrium density profiles. At a subcritical temperature, the diffusion of methane in a fully loaded SWNT follows a solidlike behavior, and the value of the diffusion coefficient varies drastically with the nanotube diameter. At a supercritical temperature, however, the diffusion coefficient at high pressure reaches a plateau, with the limiting value essentially independent of the nanotube size. For SWNTs with the radius larger than approximately 2 nm, capillary condensation occurs when the temperature is sufficiently low, following the layer-by-layer adsorption of gas molecules on the nanotube surface. For SWNTs with a diameter less than about 2 nm, no condensation is observed because the system becomes essentially one-dimensional.},

In the frame of time-correlation function theory, the generalized Einstein relations were employed to evaluate the transport coefficients. This second of a series of four papers presents the results for the self-diffusion coefficient, and discusses and interprets the behavior of this transport coefficient in the fluid region of the phase diagram. The uncertainty of the self-diffusion data is estimated to be 1\% in the gas region and 0.5\% at high-density liquid states. With the very accurate data, even fine details in the shape of the self-diffusion isotherms are resolved, and the previously little-investigated behavior of the self-diffusion coefficient at low-density gaseous states is analyzed in detail. Finally, aspects of the mass transport mechanisms on the molecular scale are explored by an analysis of the velocity autocorrelation functions.},

abstract = {The composition of methane hydrate, namely n(w) for CH4.n(w)H2O, was directly measured along the hydrate equilibrium boundary under conditions of excess methane gas. Pressure and temperature conditions ranged from 1.9 to 9.7 MPa and 263 to 285 K. Within experimental error, there is no change in hydrate composition with increasing pressure along the equilibrium boundary, but n(w) may show a slight systematic decrease away from this boundary. A hydrate stoichiometry of n(w) = 5.81-6.10 H2O describes the entire range of measured values, with an average composition of CH4.5.99(+/-0.07)H2O along the equilibrium boundary. These results, consistent with previously measured values, are discussed with respect to the widely ranging values obtained by thermodynamic analysis. The relatively constant composition of methane hydrate over the geologically relevant pressure and temperature range investigated suggests that in situ methane hydrate compositions may be estimated with some confidence.},

abstract = {Methane and ethane are each known to form structure I (sI) hydrates. However, Raman and \{NMR\} spectroscopic measurements made on clathrate hydrates formed from binary gas mixtures of methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6) indicate that structure \{II\} (sII) hydrate forms in this system for certain compositions. Raman band frequencies for ethane and 13C \{NMR\} chemical shifts for ethane were used to identify the hydrate structure in these studies. Raman spectra obtained from six different CH4+C2H6 hydrates at Lw–H–V equilibrium conditions and 274.2\&\#xa0;K indicate a change in hydrate structure from sI to sII between 72.2 and 75\&\#xa0;mol\% of methane in the vapor. Areas under peaks in the Raman spectra suggest that this change in hydrate structure is associated with a 20\% change in hydrate guest composition. Absolute cage occupancies and hydration numbers are obtained from the Raman data. Analysis of the sI to sII transition and a phase diagram for the CH4+C2H6 hydrate system are discussed. High-resolution, solid-state 13C \{NMR\} measurements at 253\&\#xa0;K confirm that CH4+C2H6 gas mixtures can form either sI or sII hydrates, depending on the vapor composition. },

@article{Berendsen1984,
abstract = {In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations the need often arises to maintain such parameters as temperature or pressure rather than energy and volume, or to impose gradients for studying transport properties in nonequilibrium MD. A method is described to realize coupling to an external bath with constant temperature or pressure with adjustable time constants for the coupling. The method is easily extendable to other variables and to gradients, and can be applied also to polyatomic molecules involving internal constraints. The influence of coupling time constants on dynamical variables is evaluated. A leap-frog algorithm is presented for the general case involving constraints with coupling to both a constant temperature and a constant pressure bath.},

@article{Matsumoto2002,
abstract = {Upon cooling, water freezes to ice. This familiar phase transition occurs widely in nature, yet unlike the freezing of simple liquids, it has never been successfully simulated on a computer. The difficulty lies with the fact that hydrogen bonding between individual water molecules yields a disordered three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network whose rugged and complex global potential energy surface permits a large number of possible network configurations. As a result, it is very challenging to reproduce the freezing of 'real' water into a solid with a unique crystalline structure. For systems with a limited number of possible disordered hydrogen-bond network structures, such as confined water, it is relatively easy to locate a pathway from a liquid state to a crystalline structure. For pure and spatially unconfined water, however, molecular dynamics simulations of freezing are severely hampered by the large number of possible network configurations that exist. Here we present a molecular dynamics trajectory that captures the molecular processes involved in the freezing of pure water. We find that ice nucleation occurs once a sufficient number of relatively long-lived hydrogen bonds develop spontaneously at the same location to form a fairly compact initial nucleus. The initial nucleus then slowly changes shape and size until it reaches a stage that allows rapid expansion, resulting in crystallization of the entire system.},

abstract = {Three distinct forms are derived for the force virial contribution to the pressure and stress tensor of a collection of atoms interacting under periodic boundary conditions. All three forms are written in terms of forces acting on atoms, and so are valid for arbitrary many-body interatomic potentials. All three forms are mathematically equivalent. In the special case of atoms interacting with pair potentials, they reduce to previously published forms. (i) The atom-cell form is similar to the standard expression for the virial for a finite nonperiodic system, but with an explicit correction for interactions with periodic images. (ii) The atom form is particularly suited to implementation in modern molecular dynamics simulation codes using spatial decomposition parallel algorithms. (iii) The group form of the virial allows the contributions to the virial to be assigned to individual atoms.},

@article{Hantal2014,
abstract = {The elastic and failure properties of a typical clay, illite, are investigated using molecular simulation. We employ a reactive (ReaxFF) and a non-reactive (ClayFF) force field to assess the elastic properties of the clay. As far as failure is concerned, ReaxFF was used throughout the study; however, some calculations were also performed with ClayFF. A crack parallel to the clay layers is found to have low fracture resistance when submitted to a tensile loading perpendicular to the crack. The mechanism of both yield and fracture failures is decohesion in the interlayer space. In contrast, under shear loading, the nanoscale failure mechanism is a stick-slip between clay layers. No fracture propagation is observed as the clay layers slide on top of each other. The low fracture resistance in mode I and the stick-slip failure in mode II are both the consequence of the lack of chemical bonds between clay layers where the cohesion is provided by non-covalent interactions. This work, which provides a description of the failure of clays at the microscopic scale, is the first step towards describing the failure of clays at a larger scale where the polycrystalline distribution of clay grains must be taken into account.},

abstract = {The thermal conductivities of common water models are compared using equilibrium (EMD) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. A complete accounting for electrostatic contributions to the heat flux was found to resolve the previously reported differing results of NEMD and EMD Green-Kubo measurements for the extended simple point-charge (SPC/E) model. Accordingly, we demonstrate the influence of long-range electrostatics on the thermal conductivity with a simple coulomb cutoff, Ewald summation, and by an extended particle-particle particle-mesh method. For each water model, the thermal conductivity is computed and decomposed in terms of frequency-dependent thermodynamic and topological contributions. The rigid, three-site SPC, SPC/E, and transferable intermolecular potential (TIP3P-Ew) water models are shown to have similar thermal conductivity values at standard conditions, whereas models that include bond stretching and angle bending have higher thermal conductivities.},

This also provides an estimate of the viscosity of all water models, which we compare to the Green-Kubo result. In all cases, a good agreement is found. The TIP4P/2005 model is in better agreement with the experimental data for both diffusion and viscosity.

abstract = {We study the system-size dependence of translational diffusion coefficients and viscosities in molecular dynamics simulations under periodic boundary conditions. Simulations of water under ambient conditions and a Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid show that the diffusion coefficients increase strongly as the system size increases. We test a simple analytic correction for the system-size effects that is based on hydrodynamic arguments. This correction scales as N-1/3, where N is the number of particles. For a cubic simulation box of length L, the diffusion coefficient corrected for system-size effects is D-0 = D-PBC + 2.837297k(B)T/(6.7pietaL), where D-PBC is the diffusion coefficient calculated in the simulation, k(B) the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, and eta the shear viscosity of the solvent. For water, LJ fluids, and hard-sphere fluids, this correction quantitatively accounts for the system-size dependence of the calculated self-diffusion coefficients. In contrast to diffusion coefficients, the shear viscosities of water and the LJ fluid show no significant system-size dependences.},

abstract = {The ability of several water models to predict the properties of ices is discussed. The emphasis is put on the results for the densities and the coexistence curves between the different ice forms. It is concluded that none of the most commonly used rigid models is satisfactory. A new model specifically designed to cope with solid-phase properties is proposed. The parameters have been obtained by fitting the equation of state and selected points of the melting lines and of the coexistence lines involving different ice forms. The phase diagram is then calculated for the new potential. The predicted melting temperature of hexagonal ice (Ih) at 1 bar is 272.2 K. This excellent value does not imply a deterioration of the rest of the properties. In fact, the predictions for both the densities and the coexistence curves are better than for TIP4P, which previously yielded the best estimations of the ice properties.},

Special attention is paid to transverse isotropy, often used to model shale. Although the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics of anisotropic solids is well established at present, this paper shows that the application of Muskhelishvili’s formalism to Lekhnitskii’s anisotropic complex potentials provides a powerful tool to extend the validity of the classical tools of isotropic fluid-driven crack models to the anisotropic case, provided that the appropriate elastic constants are used. These elastic constants are identified and derived in closed form for transversely isotropic solids.

@article{Vega2011,
abstract = {Over the last forty years many computer simulations of water have been performed using rigid non-polarizable models. Since these models describe water interactions in an approximate way it is evident that they cannot reproduce all of the properties of water. By now many properties for these kinds of models have been determined and it seems useful to compile some of these results and provide a critical view of the successes and failures. In this paper a test is proposed in which 17 properties of water, from the vapour and liquid to the solid phases, are taken into account to evaluate the performance of a water model. A certain number of points between zero (bad agreement) and ten (good agreement) are given for the predictions of each model and property. We applied the test to five rigid non-polarizable models, TIP3P, TIP5P, TIP4P, SPC/E and TIP4P/2005, obtaining an average score of 2.7, 3.7, 4.7, 5.1, and 7.2 respectively. Thus although no model reproduces all properties, some models perform better than others. It is clear that there are limitations for rigid non-polarizable models. Neglecting polarizability prevents an accurate description of virial coefficients, vapour pressures, critical pressure and dielectric constant. Neglecting nuclear quantum effects prevents an accurate description of the structure, the properties of water below 120 K and the heat capacity. It is likely that for rigid non-polarizable models it may not be possible to increase the score in the test proposed here beyond 7.6. To get closer to experiment, incorporating polarization and nuclear quantum effects is absolutely required even though a substantial increase in computer time should be expected. The test proposed here, being quantitative and selecting properties from all phases of water can be useful in the future to identify progress in the modelling of water.},

The possible occurrence of syntectonic dissociation of methane hydrate to methane plus free water in these experiments suggests that the high strength measured here may be only a lower bound. On Earth, high strength in hydrate-bearing formations implies higher energy release upon decomposition and subsequent failure. In the outer solar system, if Titan has a 100-km-thick near-surface layer of high-strength, low-thermal conductivity methane hydrate as has been suggested, its interior is likely to be considerably warmer than previously expected},

Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules were used to obtain the parameters of the cross interactions. For the TIP4P/2005 model positive deviations from the energetic Lorentz-Berthelot rule were also considered to indirectly account for the polarization of methane when introduced in liquid water. To locate the three-phase coexistence point, two different global compositions were used, which yielded (to within statistical uncertainty) the same predictions for the three-phase coexistence temperatures, although with a somewhat different time evolution. The three-phase coexistence temperatures obtained at different pressures when using the TIP4P/Ice model of water were in agreement with the experimental results. The main reason for this is that the TIP4P/Ice model reproduces the melting point of ice I(h).},

abstract = {Position and orientation of water protons need to be specified when the molecular simulation studies are performed for clathrate hydrates. Positions of oxygen atoms in water are experimentally determined by X-ray diffraction analysis of clathrate hydrate structures, but positions of water hydrogen atoms in the lattice are disordered. This study reports a determination of the water proton coordinates in unit cell of structure I (sI), II (sII), and H (sH) clathrate hydrates that satisfy the ice rules, have the lowest potential energy configuration for the protons, and give a net zero dipole moment. Possible proton coordinates in the unit cell were chosen by analyzing the symmetry of protons on the hexagonal or pentagonal faces in the hydrate cages and generating all possible proton distributions which satisfy the ice rules. We found that in the sI and sII unit cells, proton distributions with small net dipole moments have fairly narrow potential energy spreads of about 1 kJ∕mol. The total Coulomb potential on a test unit charge placed in the cage center for the minimum energy∕minimum dipole unit cell configurations was calculated. In the sI small cages, the Coulomb potential energy spread in each class of cage is less than 0.1 kJ∕mol, while the potential energy spread increases to values up to 6 kJ∕mol in sH and 15 kJ∕mol in the sII cages. The guest environments inside the cages can therefore be substantially different in the sII case. Cartesian coordinates for oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the sI, sII, and sH unit cells are reported for reference.},
