abstract = {Modeling atomic and molecular systems requires computation-intensive quantum mechanical methods such as; but not limited to; density functional theory [R. A. Friesner; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA; 102 (2005); pp. 6648–6653]. These methods have been successful in predicting various properties of chemical systems at atomistic scales. Due to the inherent nonlocality of quantum mechanics; the scalability of these methods ranges from O(N3) to O(N7) depending on the method used and approximations involved. This significantly limits the size of simulated systems to a few thousand atoms; even on large scale parallel platforms. On the other hand; classical approximations of quantum systems; although computationally (relatively) easy to implement; yield simpler models that lack essential chemical properties such as reactivity and charge transfer. The recent work of van Duin et al. [J. Phys. Chem. A; 105 (2001); pp. 9396–9409] overcomes the limitations of nonreactive classical molecular dynamics (MD) approximations by carefully incorporating limited nonlocality (to mimic quantum behavior) through an empirical bond order potential. This reactive classical MD method; called ReaxFF; achieves essential quantum properties; while retaining the computational simplicity of classical MD; to a large extent. Implementation of reactive force fields presents significant algorithmic challenges. Since these methods model bond breaking and formation; efficient implementations must rely on complex dynamic data structures. Charge transfer in these methods is accomplished by minimizing electrostatic energy through charge equilibration. This requires the solution of large linear systems (108 degrees of freedom and beyond) with shielded electrostatic kernels at each time-step. Individual time-steps are themselves typically in the range of tenths of femtoseconds; requiring optimizations within and across time-steps to scale simulations to nanoseconds and beyond; where interesting phenomena may be observed. In this paper; we present implementation details of sPuReMD (serial Purdue reactive molecular dynamics program); a unique reactive classical MD code. We describe various data structures; and the charge equilibration solver at the core of the simulation engine. This Krylov subspace solver relies on a preconditioner based on incomplete LU factorization with thresholds (ILUT); specially targeted to our application. We comprehensively validate the performance and accuracy of sPuReMD on a variety of hydrocarbon systems. In particular; we show excellent per-time-step time; linear time scaling in system size; and a low memory footprint. sPuReMD is a freely distributed software with GPL and is currently being used to model diverse systems ranging from oxidative stress in biomembranes to strain relaxation in Si-Ge nanorods.},

The model systems of fully occupied type SI CH(4) hydrate, CO(2) hydrate, and CH(4)-CO(2) mixed hydrate are prepared in a simulation box of 2 x 2 x 2 unit cell with periodic boundary conditions. The MD simulation results reveal that the CH(4)-CO(2) mixed hydrate is the most stable one in above three hydrates. The stabilization energy calculations of small and large cavities occupied by CH(4) and CO(2) show that the CO(2) molecule is less suitable for the small cavity because of its larger size compared with the CH(4) molecule but is more suitable for the large cavity. The results in this work can also explain the possibility of CH(4) molecule in reoccupying the small cavity during the replacement of CH(4) hydrate by CO(2), from the hydrate stability point of view.},

@article{Daigle2010,
abstract = {Fracture-hosted methane hydrate deposits exist at many sites worldwide. These sites often have hydrate present as vein and fracture fill, as well as disseminated through the pore space. We estimate that thousands to millions of years are required to form fracture systems by hydraulic fracturing driven by occlusion of the pore system by hydrate. This time scale is a function of rates of fluid flow and permeability loss. Low-permeability layers in a sedimentary column can reduce this time if the permeability contrast with respect to the surrounding sediments is of order 10 or greater. Additionally, we find that tensile fracturing produced by hydrate heave around hydrate lenses is a viable fracture mechanism over all but the lowermost part of the hydrate stability zone. With our coupled fluid flow-hydrate formation model we assess fracture formation at four well-studied hydrate provinces: Blake Ridge offshore South Carolina, Hydrate Ridge offshore Oregon, Keathley Canyon Block 151 offshore Louisiana, and the Krishna-Godavari Basin offshore India. We conclude that hydraulic fracturing due to pore pressure buildup is reasonable only at Hydrate Ridge and the Krishna-Godavari Basin owing to sediment age constraints, and that hydrate-filled fractures observed at Blake Ridge and Keathley Canyon Block 151 are formed either by hydrate heave or in preexisting fractures. Our findings offer new insight into the processes and time scales associated with fracture-hosted hydrate deposits, which help further our understanding of hydrate systems. },

In the computations, all model parameters are evaluated from physical properties taken from experiment or molecular dynamics simulations. It has been found that hydrate conversion is a diffusion controlled process, as after a short transient, the displacement of the conversion front scales with t(1/2). Assuming a diffusion coefficient of D(s) = 1.1 x 10(-11) m(2) s(-1) in the hydrate phase, the predicted time dependent conversion rate is in reasonable agreement with results from magnetic resonance imaging experiments. This value of the diffusion coefficient is higher than expected for the bulk hydrate phase, probably due to liquid inclusions remaining in the porous sample used in the experiment.},

@article{Klapp2010,
abstract = {In underwater hydrocarbon seepage environments, gas hydrates are considered to play a significant role as shallow gas reservoirs and buffers for light hydrocarbon expulsion. Here we report on mixed hydrate structures from the Chapopote Knoll in the southern Gulf of Mexico and discuss several options on how a mixture of structure I (sI) and structure II (sII) gas hydrate may occur in nature. Locally resolving microscopic methods are needed to characterize the coexistence of different hydrate structures at geological hydrate deposits; we used Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and gas chromatography for our investigations. Gas hydrates were found within the matrix and pores of the asphalts extruded at the seafloor. Two of the three hydrate pieces investigated comprised only sI, formed mostly from methane. In contrast, one piece comprised an intimate mixture of both sI and sII with sII representing ca. 25 wt.\% and sI ca. 75 wt.\% of the hydrate present. The two structures were closely associated within individual grain agglomerates. The crystallites of sII were significantly larger than of sI, suggesting differences in the nucleation density or different crystallite ages. The structural coexistence may be a result of one or more processes: i) de-mixing into two hydrate structures during the growth from the gas phase, which provides an additional degree of freedom for lowering the free energy in the system; ii) fractionated crystallization with a subsequently changing molecular composition; iii) crystallization from separated gas bubbles with different hydrocarbon compositions and water; and iv) partial transformation from sII to sI after hydrate nucleation, ceasing when a thermodynamically stable state was reached. The presented work will affect future assessments of natural hydrate deposits at thermogenic hydrocarbon systems, as it shows that both hydrate types I and II can be present at a certain geological site, and may provide a lingering strength to the system if conditions fall below the sI stability limit. This suggests that present worldwide hydrate occurrences are likely to be underestimated.},

@article{Deusner2012,
abstract = {The recovery of natural gas from CH4-hydrate deposits in sub-marine and 
sub-permafrost environments through injection of CO2 is considered a suitable strategy towards emission-neutral energy production. This study shows that the injection of hot, supercritical CO2 is particularly promising. The addition of heat triggers the dissociation of CH4-hydrate while the CO2, once thermally equilibrated, reacts with the pore water and is retained in the reservoir as immobile CO2-hydrate. Furthermore, optimal reservoir conditions of pressure and temperature are constrained. Experiments were conducted in a high-pressure flow-through reactor at different sediment temperatures (2 °C, 8 °C, 10 °C) and hydrostatic pressures (8 MPa, 13 MPa). The efficiency of both, CH4 production and CO2 retention is best at 8 °C, 13 MPa. Here, both CO2- and CH4-hydrate as well as mixed hydrates can form. At 2 °C, the production process was less effective due to congestion of transport pathways through the sediment by rapidly forming CO2-hydrate. In contrast, at 
10 °C CH4 production suffered from local increases in permeability and fast breakthrough of the injection fluid, thereby confining the accessibility to the CH4 pool to only the most prominent fluid channels. Mass and volume balancing of the collected gas and fluid stream identified gas mobilization as equally important process parameter in addition to the rates of methane hydrate dissociation and hydrate conversion. Thus, the combination of heat supply and CO2 injection in one supercritical phase helps to overcome the mass transfer limitations usually observed in experiments with cold liquid or gaseous CO2.},

abstract = {The dynamics of water confined to mesoporous regions in minerals such as swelling clays and zeolites is fundamental to a wide range of resource management issues impacting many processes on a global scale, including radioactive waste containment, desalination, and enhanced oil recovery. Large-scale atomic models of freely diffusing multilayer smectite particles at low hydration confined in a silicalite cage are used to investigate water dynamics in the composite environment with the ReaxFF reactive force field over a temperature range of 300-647 K. The reactive capability of the force field enabled a range of relevant surface chemistry to emerge, including acid/base equilibria in the interlayer calcium hydrates and silanol formation on the edges of the clay and inner surface of the zeolite housing. After annealing, the resulting clay models exhibit both mono- and bilayer hydration structures. Clay surface hydration redistributed markedly and yielded to silicalite water loading. We find that the absolute rates and temperature dependence of water dynamics compare well to neutron scattering data and pulse field gradient measures from relevant samples of Ca-montmorillonite and silicalite, respectively. Within an atomistic, reactive context, our results distinguish water dynamics in the interlayer Ca(OH)(2)·nH(2)O environment from water flowing over the clay surface, and from water diffusing within silicalite. We find that the diffusion of water when complexed to Ca hydrates is considerably slower than freely diffusing water over the clay surface, and the reduced mobility is well described by a difference in the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor rather than a change in activation energy.},

abstract = {A new reactive force field has been derived that allows the modelling of speciation in the aqueous-calcium carbonate system. Using the ReaxFF methodology, which has now been implemented in the program GULP, calcium has been simulated as a fixed charge di-cation species in both crystalline phases, such as calcite and aragonite, as well as in the solution phase. Excluding calcium from the charge equilibration process appears to have no adverse effects for the simulation of species relevant to the aqueous environment. Based on this model, the speciation of carbonic acid, bicarbonate and carbonate have been examined in microsolvated conditions, as well as bulk water. When immersed in a droplet of 98 water molecules and two hydronium ions, the carbonate ion is rapidly converted to bicarbonate, and ultimately carbonic acid, which is formed as the metastable cis-trans isomer under kinetic control. Both first principles and ReaxFF calculations exhibit the same behaviour, but the longer timescale accessible to the latter allows the diffusion of the carbonic acid to the surface of the water to be observed, where it is more stable at the interface. Calcium carbonate is also examined as ion pairs in solution for both CaCO(3)(0)((aq)) and CaHCO(3)(+)((aq)), in addition to the (1014) surface in contact with water.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of core samples in laboratory experiments showed that CO2 storage in gas hydrates formed in porous rock resulted in the spontaneous production of methane with no associated water production. The exposure of methane hydrate in the pores to liquid CO2 resulted in methane production from the hydrate that suggested the exchange of methane molecules with CO2 molecules within the hydrate without the addition or subtraction of significant amounts of heat. Thermodynamic simulations based on Phase Field Theory were in agreement with these results and predicted similar methane production rates that were observed in several experiments. MRI-based 3D visualizations of the formation of hydrates in the porous rock and the methane production improved the interpretation of the experiments. The sequestration of an important greenhouse gas while simultaneously producing the freed natural gas offers access to the significant amounts of energy bound in natural gas hydrates and also offers an attractive potential for CO2 storage. The potential danger associated with catastrophic dissociation of hydrate structures in nature and the corresponding collapse of geological formations is reduced because of the increased thermodynamic stability of the CO2 hydrate relative to the natural gas hydrate.},

abstract = {This paper is intended to determine the appropriate conditions for replacing CH4 from NGH with CO2. By analyzing the hydration equilibrium graphs and geotherms, the HSZs of NGH and CO2 hydrate, both in permafrost and under deep sea, were determined. Based on the above analysis and experimental results, it is found that to replace CH4 from NGH with gaseous CO2, the appropriate experimental condition should be in the area surrounded by four curves: the geotherm, (H-V)(CO2), (L-V)(CO2) and (H-V)(CH4), and to replace CH4 from NGH with liquid CO2, the condition should be in the area surrounded by three curves: (L-V)(CO2), (H-L)(CO2) and (H-V)CH4. For conditions in other areas, either CO2 can not form a hydrate or CH4 can release little from its hydrate, which are not desirable results. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Images were obtained by using a fast spin-echo sequence, and the field of view was set to 40×40×40 mm. The vessel pressure was monitored during hydrate formation and dissociation, which was used to compare with MRI mean intensity. The result indicated that the MRI could visualize hydrate formation and dissociation, and the MRI mean intensity of water was in good agreement with the vessel pressure changes. The hydrate formation and dissociation rates were also quantified using the MRI mean intensity of water. The experimental results showed that the higher heating rate caused the rapid hydrate dissociation.},

Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to show that the replacement can take place without melting of the network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Depending on the distance to the interface between the liquid CO(2) and solid clathrate hydrate, we find that the replacement occurs either via direct swapping of methane and CO(2) or via a transient co-occupation of both methane and CO(2) in one cavity. Our results suggest that, with a careful design of the operation condition, it is possible to replace methane from methane hydrates with CO(2) in the solid phase without much change in the geological stability.},

Molecular dynamics calculations on structure I methane clathrate hydrate reproduced the qualitative trend in the thermal conductivity. Analysis of the heat flux and local energy correlation functions shows that both the crystal structure of the clathrate framework and guest-host interactions contribute to thermal transport processes. The lower thermal conductivity relative to ice Ih is due to differences in crystal structures. The glasslike temperature dependence is governed by the guests and the guest-host interactions.},

These disordered structures have dynamic and structural properties intermediate between those exhibited by molecules in bulk liquid and crystalline phases. The presence of methane molecules appears to help stabilize these structures.

abstract = {Interest in describing clathrate hydrate formation mechanisms spans multiple fields of science and technical applications. Here, we report findings from multiple molecular dynamics simulations of spontaneous methane clathrate hydrate nucleation and growth from fully demixed and disordered two-phase fluid systems of methane and water. Across a range of thermodynamic conditions and simulation geometries and sizes, a set of seven cage types comprises approximately 95\% of all cages formed in the nucleated solids. This set includes the ubiquitous 5(12) cage, the 5(12)6(n) subset (where n ranges from 2-4), and the 4(1)5(10)6(n) subset (where n also ranges from 2-4). Transformations among these cages occur via water pair insertions/removals and rotations, and may elucidate the mechanisms of solid-solid structural rearrangements observed experimentally. Some consistency is observed in the relative abundance of cages among all nucleation trajectories. 5(12) cages are always among the two most abundant cage types in the nucleated solids and are usually the most abundant cage type. In all simulations, the 5(12)6(n) cages outnumber their 4(1)5(10)6(n) counterparts with the same number of water molecules. Within these consistent features, some stochasticity is observed in certain cage ratios and in the long-range ordering of the nucleated solids. Even when comparing simulations performed at the same conditions, some trajectories yield swaths of multiple adjacent sI unit cells and long-range order over 5 nm, while others yield only isolated sI unit cells and little long-range order. The nucleated solids containing long-range order have higher 5(12)6(2)/5(12) and 5(12)6(3)/4(1)5(10)6(2) cage ratios when compared to systems that nucleate with little long-range order. The formation of multiple adjacent unit cells of sI hydrate at high driving forces suggests an alternative or addition to the prevailing hydrate nucleation hypotheses which involve formation through amorphous intermediates.},

abstract = {The vast amount of hydrocarbon gas deposited in the earth's crust as gas hydrates has significant implications for future energy supply and global climate. A 3-D simulator for methane hydrate formation and dissociation in porous media is developed for designing and interpreting laboratory and field hydrate experiments. Four components (hydrate, methane, water and salt) and five phases (hydrate, gas, aqueous-phase, ice and salt precipitate) are considered in the simulator. The intrinsic kinetics of hydrate formation or dissociation is considered using the Kim-Bishnoi model. Water freezing and ice melting are tracked with primary variable switch method (PVSM) by assuming equilibrium phase transition. Mass transport, including two-phase flow and molecular diffusions, and heat transfer involved in formation or dissociation of hydrates are included in the governing equations, which are discretized with finite volume difference method and are solved in a fully implicit manner. The developed simulator is used here to study the formation and the dissociation of hydrates in laboratory-scale core samples. In hydrate formation from the system of gas and ice (G+I) and in hydrate dissociation systems where ice appears, the equilibrium between aqueous-phase and ice (A-I) is found to have a "blocking" effect on heat transfer when salt is absent from the system. Increase of initial temperature (at constant outlet pressure), introduction of salt component into the system, decrease of outlet pressure, and increase of boundary heat transfer coefficient can lead to faster hydrate dissociation.},

abstract = {Methane is the prototypic hydrophobic molecule; it has an extremely low solubility in liquid water that leads to phase segregation. On the other hand, at moderate pressures and room temperature, water and methane form hydrate clathrate crystals with a methane to water ratio up to a 1000 times higher than the saturated aqueous phase. This apparent dichotomy points to a subtle balance between the strong water-water hydrogen bonding, responsible for the hydrophobic effect, and water-methane attraction. Capturing these nuances with molecular models requires an appropriate balance of intermolecular interactions. Here we present such a coarse-grained molecular model of water and methane that represents each molecule by a single particle interacting through very short-range interaction potentials. The model is based on the monatomic model of water mW [Molinero, V.; Moore, E. B. J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113, 4008] and is between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than atomistic models with Ewald sums. The coarse-grained model of this study reproduces the solubility and hydration number of methane in liquid water, the surface tension of the water-methane interface and the equilibrium melting temperature of methane hydrate clathrates with structures sI and sII. To the best of our knowledge this is the first force-field, atomistic or coarse-grained, that reproduces these range of properties of liquid and solid phases of water and methane, making it an efficient and accurate model for the study of the mechanisms of nucleation and growth of clathrates. We expect that the results of this work will also be useful for the modeling of the hydrophobic assembly in aqueous solutions and the development of coarse-grained models of biomolecules with explicit solvation.},

abstract = {Understanding the microscopic mechanism of nucleation of clathrate hydrates is important for their use in hydrogen storage, CO(2) sequestration, storage and transport of natural gas, and the prevention of the formation of hydrate plugs in oil and gas pipelines. These applications involve hydrate guests of varied sizes and solubility in water that form different hydrate crystal structures. Nevertheless, molecular studies of the mechanism of nucleation of hydrates have focused on the single class of small hydrophobic guests that stabilize the sI crystal. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations with a very efficient coarse-grained model to elucidate the mechanisms of nucleation of clathrate hydrates of four model guests that span a 2 orders of magnitude range in solubility in water and that encompass sizes which stabilize each one a different hydrate structure (sI and sII, with and without occupancy of the dodecahedral cages). We find that the overall mechanism of clathrate nucleation is similar for all guests and involves a first step of formation of blobs, dense clusters of solvent-separated guest molecules that are the birthplace of the clathrate cages. Blobs of hydrophobic guests are rarer and longer-lived than those for soluble guests. For each guest, we find multiple competing channels to form the critical nuclei, filled dodecahedral (5(12)) cages, empty 5(12) cages, and a variety of filled large (5(12)6(n) with n = 2, 3, and 4) clathrate cages. Formation of empty dodecahedra is an important nucleation channel for all but the smallest guest. The empty 5(12) cages are stabilized by the presence of guests from the blob in their first solvation shell. Under conditions of high supercooling, the structure of the critical and subcritical nuclei is mainly determined by the size of the guest and does not reflect the cage composition or ordering of the stable or metastable clathrate crystals.},

@article{Molinero2009,
abstract = {Water and silicon are chemically dissimilar substances with common physical properties. Their liquids display a temperature of maximum density, increased diffusivity on compression, and they form tetrahedral crystals and tetrahedral amorphous phases. The common feature to water, silicon, and carbon is the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated units. We exploit these similarities to develop a coarse-grained model of water (mW) that is essentially an atom with tetrahedrality intermediate between carbon and silicon. mW mimics the hydrogen-bonded structure of water through the introduction of a nonbond angular dependent term that encourages tetrahedral configurations. The model departs from the prevailing paradigm in water modeling: the use of long-ranged forces (electrostatics) to produce short-ranged (hydrogen-bonded) structure. mW has only short-range interactions yet it reproduces the energetics, density and structure of liquid water, and its anomalies and phase transitions with comparable or better accuracy than the most popular atomistic models of water, at less than 1\% of the computational cost. We conclude that it is not the nature of the interactions but the connectivity of the molecules that determines the structural and thermodynamic behavior of water. The speedup in computing time provided by mW makes it particularly useful for the study of slow processes in deeply supercooled water, the mechanism of ice nucleation, wetting-drying transitions, and as a realistic water model for coarse-grained simulations of biomolecules and complex materials.},

abstract = {The ability of several water models to predict the properties of ices is discussed. The emphasis is put on the results for the densities and the coexistence curves between the different ice forms. It is concluded that none of the most commonly used rigid models is satisfactory. A new model specifically designed to cope with solid-phase properties is proposed. The parameters have been obtained by fitting the equation of state and selected points of the melting lines and of the coexistence lines involving different ice forms. The phase diagram is then calculated for the new potential. The predicted melting temperature of hexagonal ice (Ih) at 1 bar is 272.2 K. This excellent value does not imply a deterioration of the rest of the properties. In fact, the predictions for both the densities and the coexistence curves are better than for TIP4P, which previously yielded the best estimations of the ice properties.},

abstract = {Monte Carlo simulation methods for determining fluid- and crystal-phase chemical potentials are used for the first time to calculate liquid water-methane hydrate-methane vapor phase equilibria from knowledge of atomistic interaction potentials alone. The water and methane molecules are modeled using the TIP4P/ice potential and a united-atom Lennard-Jones potential, respectively. The equilibrium calculation method for this system has three components, (i) thermodynamic integration from a supercritical ideal gas to obtain the fluid-phase chemical potentials, (ii) calculation of the chemical potential of the zero-occupancy hydrate system using thermodynamic integration from an Einstein crystal reference state, and (iii) thermodynamic integration to obtain the water and guest molecules' chemical potentials as a function of the hydrate occupancy. The three-phase equilibrium curve is calculated for pressures ranging from 20 to 500 bar and is shown to follow the Clapeyron behavior, in agreement with experiment; coexistence temperatures differ from the latter by 4-16 K in the pressure range studied. The enthalpy of dissociation extracted from the calculated P-T curve is within 2\% of the experimental value at corresponding conditions. While computationally intensive, simulations such as these are essential to map the thermodynamically stable conditions for hydrate systems.},

abstract = {The nucleation and growth of clathrate hydrates of a hydrophobic guest comparable to methane or carbon dioxide are studied by molecular dynamics simulations of two-phase systems. The crystallization proceeds in two steps: First, the guest molecules concentrate in "blobs", amorphous clusters involving multiple guest molecules in water-mediated configurations. These blobs are in dynamic equilibrium with the dilute solution and give birth to the clathrate cages that eventually transform it into an amorphous clathrate nucleus. In a second step, the amorphous clathrate transforms into crystalline clathrate. At low temperatures, the system can be arrested in the metastable amorphous clathrate phase for times sufficiently long for it to appear as an intermediate in the crystallization of clathrates. The "blob mechanism" unveiled in this work synthesizes elements of the labile cluster and local structuring hypotheses of clathrate nucleation and bears strong analogies to the two-step mechanisms of crystallization of proteins and colloids.},

@article{Matsumoto2002,
abstract = {Upon cooling, water freezes to ice. This familiar phase transition occurs widely in nature, yet unlike the freezing of simple liquids, it has never been successfully simulated on a computer. The difficulty lies with the fact that hydrogen bonding between individual water molecules yields a disordered three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network whose rugged and complex global potential energy surface permits a large number of possible network configurations. As a result, it is very challenging to reproduce the freezing of 'real' water into a solid with a unique crystalline structure. For systems with a limited number of possible disordered hydrogen-bond network structures, such as confined water, it is relatively easy to locate a pathway from a liquid state to a crystalline structure. For pure and spatially unconfined water, however, molecular dynamics simulations of freezing are severely hampered by the large number of possible network configurations that exist. Here we present a molecular dynamics trajectory that captures the molecular processes involved in the freezing of pure water. We find that ice nucleation occurs once a sufficient number of relatively long-lived hydrogen bonds develop spontaneously at the same location to form a fairly compact initial nucleus. The initial nucleus then slowly changes shape and size until it reaches a stage that allows rapid expansion, resulting in crystallization of the entire system.},
