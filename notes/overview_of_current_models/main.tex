The intention of this document is to give an overview of current molecular dynamics models of gas hydrates. What are the methods and what potentials are in use? The strategy will be to find some review articles, to find papers that have had some impact, and inspect the methods used in those papers. 

\section{}
A particularly interesting review article is \cite{Barnes2013}. It cites and/or recommends 48 papers on clathrate hydrates of which only a handful were published before 2010. 4 of the papers cited here are tagged as "of outstanding interest". Then a few more are tagged as "of special interest". The rest might be of interest, but the tagged papers will be prioritized. 
A paper that got some attention in 2009 was \cite{Walsh2009}. It also got a perspective article \cite{Debenedetti2009}.
